              Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all
              stages of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a
              rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking
              coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and
              batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly
              coffee, so that brewing is east and enjoyable.
